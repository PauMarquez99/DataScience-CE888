# Causal Inference CE888 Assignment 1 
The following repository is dedicated to the Assignment 1 of CE888 - Causal Inference. There are two jupyter notebooks in this folder, as well as the datasets used in .CSV and .NPZ format. 

## Description
The notebooks found here are the first step to analyze and work the IHDP and JOBS dataframes for a causal inference project. Both of them represent diffent types of datasets, the first mention being simulated due to having factual and counterfactual outcomes, while the second one is an experiment data mixed with observational data as well.

Further improvements will be made when the second assignment is developed.
## How to Use 
The user should have python3, numpy, pandas and matplot installed in their device in order for the notebook to run smoothly, but there is also the option of exporting the file and working in Colab without the need of the previous installations.


## Datasets Used in the Project
Look under [project](https://github.com/dmachlanski/CE888_2022/tree/main/project) directory to find the datasets in .csv format.
